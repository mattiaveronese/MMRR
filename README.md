# MMRR
In this work we introduce a novel partial volume correction (PVC) method called Multiresolutionâ€“Multimodal Resolution-Recovery (MMRR), which uses the wavelet transform and a synergistic statistical models to exploit MRI structural images to improve the resolution of [11C]PIB PET myelin imaging. 
MMRR performance was tested on a phantom acquisition and in a dataset comprising [11C]PIB PET and MR T1- and T2-weighted images of 8 healthy controls and 20 MS patients. For further information please refer to JCBFM publication (https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678X17712183)

The project contains
- MMRR source code (Run in Matlab 2012b)
- The accepted version of the manuscript and associated supplementary material.
