# MMRR
In this work we introduce a novel partial volume correction (PVC) method called Multiresolutionâ€“Multimodal Resolution-Recovery (MMRR),which uses the wavelet transform and a synergistic statistical models to exploit MRI structural images to improve the resolution of [11C]PIB PET myelin imaging. 
MMRR performance was tested on a phantom acquisition and in a dataset comprising [11C]PIB PET and MR T1- and T2-weighted images of 8 healthy controls and 20 MS patients. For further information please refer to JCBFM publication
